This code can be used to derive stickiness based on any humid heat metric which combines measurements of temperature and humidity. In the main text of Ivanovich et al. 2024, we show results for the derivation using wet bulb temperature, moist static energy, and Humidex. The code in the file here titled "stickiness_derivation.py" uses wet bulb temperature as its template, but this entry can be substituted for any other humid heat metric chosen by the user.
